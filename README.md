Enhanced Dysgraphia Handwriting to Text Conversion Tool

Overview

This project presents an advanced tool designed to convert handwriting from individuals with dysgraphia into digital text. The neural network model is trained on a specialized dataset of dysgraphic handwriting, focusing on alphabet recognition. The primary objective is to accurately identify and convert each alphabet character, providing a significant utility for individuals with dysgraphia and those working with them.

Features

Neural Network Architecture: A custom neural network trained specifically on dysgraphia-affected handwriting.
Alphabet Recognition: The model accurately identifies individual alphabet characters from images of handwritten text.
Dataset: A comprehensive dataset containing various handwriting samples from individuals with dysgraphia.
User Interface: A simple interface to upload handwriting images and receive the corresponding text output.
Performance Metrics: Detailed metrics on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the model.
